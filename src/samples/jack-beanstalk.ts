Once upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottage with her only son Jack.


Jack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kind-hearted and affectionate.


There had been a hard winter, and after it the poor woman had suffered from fever and ague.


Jack did no work as yet, and by degrees they grew dreadfully poor.


The widow saw that there was no means of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling her cow.


So one morning she said to her son, "Jack, I am too weak to go myself, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her."


Jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was on the way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand.


Jack stopped to look at them, and the butcher told the boy that they were of great value, and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow for these beans.


When he brought them home to his mother, instead of the money she expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed, and shed many tears, scolding Jack for his folly.


He was very sorry, and mother and son went to bed very sadly that night.


Their last hope seemed gone.


At daybreak Jack rose and went out into the garden.


"At least," he thought, "I will sow the wonderful beans.


Mother says that they are just common scarlet runners, and nothing else; but I may as well sow them."


So he took a piece of stick and made some holes in the ground, and put in the beans.


That day they had very little dinner, and went sadly to bed, knowing that for the next day there would be none.


Jack awoke very early in the morning, and seeing something uncommon darken the window, he ran into the garden.


There he saw a wonderful sight.


The beans he had sown had sprung up in the night, and grown up and up until the stalks looked like a great ladder reaching to the sky.


He ran and told his mother, and she came out, but she was very much frightened.


"It is some magic," she said, "and we ought to have nothing to do with it.


"However, Jack was bent upon climbing up the bean-stalk.


So he said to his mother, "Don't be afraid. I must go and see where it leads."


And she begged and prayed him not to risk his life; but he coaxed her to give him leave to go, and she at last consented.


Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-like bean-stalk, till everything he had known, the cottage, the village, and even the tall church tower, looked quite little, and still he could not see the top of the bean-stalk.


Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would go back again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the way to succeed in anything is not to give up.


So after resting for a moment, he went on.


After climbing higher and higher till he grew afraid to look down for fear he should be giddy, Jack at last reached the top of the bean-stalk, and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded, with beautiful meadows covered with sheep.


A crystal stream ran through the pastures; not far from the place where he had got off the bean-stalk stood a fine, strong castle.


Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle before; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was as high above his father's house as the big church steeple was above the ground.


While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange-looking woman came out of the wood, and advanced toward him.


She was an old fairy, who had passed the house of Jack's father when he was a baby, and had cast a spell over him for a slight offence his father had committed.


Jack, who was a gallant boy, and did not much like the fairy's appearance, sprang to his feet and drew back.


"Who are you?" he said; "and how came you to know my name?"


The old woman answered that she was a fairy, and that she knew more about him than he could possibly imagine.


"Listen, Jack," she said; "do not be afraid of me; I am an old woman, but I am very good and very powerful, and I have a great mind to help you.


When you were a very little boy, your father, a brave knight, was killed by the giant who lives in yonder castle.


"It was his cruel castle.


Your mother is a poor woman now, and the land is desolate because of the cruel giant.


"He was a very strong giant, and very wicked, and he feared neither God nor man.


He lived in that castle and was the terror of all the country round.


Jack was very sorrowful to hear what she said.


"But you must promise," continued the fairy, "to be obedient and follow my directions.


If you do not, you will perish, and all will be lost.


"Jack was very ready to promise to be obedient and follow the fairy's directions.


"Go along the road," said the fairy, "till you come to a large house, where a poor woman lives.


Ask her to give you some breakfast, and be sure you call her 'mother.'


Then the fairy disappeared, and Jack walked on till he reached the house, where he found the poor woman of whom the fairy had spoken.


She was very much astonished to see Jack, and said that it was a long time since she had seen any human being, for she lived in constant dread of the giant who dwelt in the castle.


Jack spoke to her as he had been told, and called her "mother," and asked for some breakfast.


She instantly gave him some, for she thought no harm in him; but when he asked for a night's lodging, she told him she dared not let him stay, for the giant, her husband, would kill him if he caught him in the house.


However, Jack promised that he would never let the giant see him, and he at last persuaded the good woman to give him a night's lodging.


In the evening Jack heard a great noise like the tramp of an army on the march, and he grew very frightened, but the woman said it was only the giant her husband coming home.


She hid Jack in the oven and bade him lie still.


The giant came in saying:


"Fee, fi, fo, fum,


I smell the blood of an Englishman.


Be he alive, or be he dead,


I'll grind his bones to make my bread."


The wife said, "There is no one here but yourself, so sit down and eat your supper."


So the giant sat down, and his wife brought a great big bowl of hasty pudding, and a huge loaf, and the giant ate it all up and went to bed.


Jack lay very still in the oven, and listened to the giant snoring in his sleep.


Then he stole out, took a bag of gold from the table, and ran away to the bean-stalk, which he descended like lightning, and found his mother very much grieved, for she feared he had come to some harm.


But Jack showed her the gold and told her he had stolen it from the castle of the giant, who had killed his father.


His mother was very glad to see the gold, but she was very much afraid that if the giant missed it he would come and do them some harm.


However, after a time Jack made another journey up the bean-stalk, and he came to the house of the woman who had given him breakfast before.


She gave him some supper and put him in the oven again; and presently the giant came in saying:


"Fee, fi, fo, fum,


I smell the blood of an Englishman.


Be he alive, or be he dead,


I'll grind his bones to make my bread."


The wife said, "There is no one here but yourself, so sit down and eat your supper."


So the giant sat down, and his wife brought him a great big bowl of hasty pudding and a huge loaf, and he ate it all up and went to bed.


Jack lay very still in the oven, and listened to the giant snoring in his sleep.


Then he stole out and took a hen that laid golden eggs and ran away to the bean-stalk, which he climbed down like lightning, and found his mother at the foot of it, very glad to see him again.


Jack made a third journey up the bean-stalk, and he went to the house of the giant's wife, who was very kind and gave him something to eat and hid him in the oven.


When the giant came in, he said:


"Fee, fi, fo, fum,


I smell the blood of an Englishman.


Be he alive, or be he dead,


I'll grind his bones to make my bread."


The wife said, "There is no one here but yourself, so sit down and eat your supper."


So the giant sat down, and his wife brought him a great big bowl of hasty pudding and a huge loaf, and he ate it all up and went to bed.


Jack lay very still in the oven, and listened to the giant snoring in his sleep.


Then he stole out and took a harp that played all kinds of beautiful music, and ran away to the bean-stalk, which he climbed down like lightning.


But the harp called out, "Master! master!" and the giant woke up and came running after Jack.


But Jack was too quick for him, and he ran down the bean-stalk and called out to his mother


Jack was too quick for him, and he ran down the bean-stalk and called out to his mother for an axe.


The widow hurried out with the axe, and just as the giant was coming down the bean-stalk, she cut the stalk quite through, and down came the giant with a terrible crash, and that was the end of him.


But Jack's adventures were not yet over, for the bean-stalk withered away, and his mother was very glad to see him again.


Jack's adventures were not yet over, for the bean-stalk withered away, and his mother was very glad to see him again.


Jack showed his mother the hen that laid golden eggs and the harp that played all kinds of beautiful music, and he carried them to the village, and they were sold for a great deal of money, and everybody was very glad to see Jack and his mother.


And so Jack and his mother lived happily ever after.`;
