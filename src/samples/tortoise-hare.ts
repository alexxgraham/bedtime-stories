Once upon a time, there was a speedy hare who bragged about how fast he could run.


Tired of hearing him boast, the tortoise challenged him to a race.


"All right," said the hare, laughing at such an idea.


The race began, and the hare, being such a swift runner, soon left the tortoise far behind.


About halfway through the race, confident of winning, he decided to rest under a tree for some time.


The hare woke up with a start and ran as fast as he could, but it was too late.


The tortoise had crossed the finish line, and the hare was too far behind to catch up.`;
